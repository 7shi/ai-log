    Tamil is very conservative. Tamil is most similar to proto-Dravidian in Dravidian languages.

Yes, you're correct. Tamil is indeed considered a conservative language within the Dravidian language family. It has preserved many features of Proto-Dravidian, the hypothetical common ancestor of the Dravidian languages. This includes its phonetic and grammatical structures. However, like all languages, Tamil has also evolved and changed over time, influenced by contact with other languages and cultures. It's this balance between preservation and innovation that makes the study of Tamil and other Dravidian languages so fascinating.

    What is the origin of Tamil language?

Tamil is a Dravidian language that descends from Proto-Dravidian. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the third millennium BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India³⁵. The earliest Tamil writing is attested in inscriptions and potsherds from the 5th century BCE². Three periods have been distinguished through analyses of grammatical and lexical changes: Old Tamil (from about 450 BCE to 700 CE), Middle Tamil (700–1600), and Modern Tamil (from 1600)².

As for books on the history of the Tamil language, here are a few recommendations:
1. "Tamil: A Biography" by David Shulman⁶. This book presents a comprehensive cultural history of Tamil—language, literature, and civilization—emphasizing how Tamil speakers and poets have understood the unique features of their language over its long history.
2. "The Dravidian Languages" by Bhadriraju Krishnamurti². This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the Dravidian languages, including Tamil.
3. "கி.மு கி.பி [Ki.Mu Ki.Pi]" by Madhan⁸. This book, written in Tamil, explores the history of the world from the perspective of Tamil and Dravidian history.

    Was the Dravidian language spoken throughout the Indian subcontinent before the arrival of the Aryans?

Yes, it is believed that Dravidian languages were originally spoken across the entire Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Aryan languages, which include Sanskrit, were not native to India but were introduced by Aryan invaders from the north³. The presence of Dravidian loanwords in the Rigveda, one of the oldest texts in any Indo-European language, suggests that Dravidian and Aryan speakers had already fused into one speech community in the Indo-Gangetic Plain by the time of its composition². 

The most ancient forms of the Dravidian languages are found in southern India, which was not exposed to Sanskrit until the 5th century BCE². This suggests that the south was populated by speakers of the Dravidian languages even before the entry of Aryans into India². 

However, the origins of the Dravidians are a complex subject of research and debate¹. They are regarded as indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, but may have deeper pre-Neolithic roots from Western Asia, specifically from the Iranian plateau¹. Their origins are often viewed as being connected with the Indus Valley civilization¹. After the demise of the Indus Valley Civilization in the early second millennium BCE, Dravidian people and language spread east and southwards¹. Some propose this happened not long before the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers, with whom they intensively interacted¹. 

Please note that these are theories based on linguistic and archaeological evidence, and there is ongoing research in this field. It's always a good idea to check the latest research for the most up-to-date information.

    There is a theory that there is a relationship between Tamil and Japanese.

Yes, there is a theory proposed by Professor Susumu Ono of Gakushuin University in 1981, suggesting an ancient link between the Japanese and Tamil languages¹². In his research, Professor Ono asserted that both Tamil and Japanese share a common ancestry¹. He compared linguistics, sounds, words, grammar, literature, as well as archaeology and folklore of both languages¹. He also found remarkable similarities in pottery, burial habits, and graffiti marks between the Yayoi burials of Japan and the Megalithic burials of South India and Sri Lanka (1300 BCE – 300 CE)¹.

However, this theory is not universally accepted and is considered provocative. Some sources state that Tamil and Japanese belong to different language families and are not related³. Therefore, while there are some similarities and interesting hypotheses, more research is needed to establish a definitive relationship between Tamil and Japanese. It's a fascinating area of study! 😊

    What are some other theories about the origin of Dravidian?

The Dravidian languages are a family of languages spoken by more than 215 million people in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka¹. The consensus of the research community is that the Dravidians are natives of the Indian subcontinent and were present prior to the arrival of the Indo-Aryans (Indo-European speakers) in India around 3,500 years ago⁴.

There is considerable literature on the theory that India is a linguistic area where different language families have developed convergent structures through extensive regional and societal bilingualism¹. It is now well established that the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language families developed convergent structures in sound system (phonology) and grammar owing to contact going back to the 2nd millennium BCE¹.

The presence of Dravidian loanwords in the Rigveda implies that Dravidian and Aryan speakers were, by the time of its composition, fused into one speech community in the great Indo-Gangetic Plain¹. Notably, the most ancient forms of the Dravidian languages are found in southern India, which was not exposed to Sanskrit until the 5th century BCE¹.

Another theory proposed by Susumu Ōno and Homer B. Hulbert suggests that early Dravidian people, especially Tamils, migrated to the Korean peninsula and Japan⁵. However, this theory is based on the Turanian language hypothesis, which has been obsolete since the early 20th century⁵.

These theories provide a glimpse into the complex history and origins of the Dravidian languages. However, the exact geographical origin and dispersal of the Dravidian language through time are still not known with certainty⁴..

    What is Turanian language hypothesis?

The Turanian language hypothesis is an obsolete proposal for a language family that includes most of the languages of Eurasia not included in Indo-European, Semitic, and Chinese¹. This hypothesis was proposed by Max Müller, who named it after Turan, an ancient Persian term for the lands of Central Asia¹. 

Müller's classification of the Turanian family was as follows¹:
- Northern Division (Ural-Altaic): Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic, Samoyedic, Finnic
- Southern Division: Taic, Malaic (Malayo-Polynesian), Bhotîya (Tibeto-Burman), Gangetic, Lohitic, Munda, Tamulic (Dravidian)

He left Japonic, Koreanic, Koryak, Itelmen, and various languages of the Caucasus unclassified, but suggested that they might have a common origin with Turanian¹.

However, this hypothesis is no longer accepted. Linguists no longer consider typological features a sufficient criterion for the identification of language families¹. Müller's northern division, Ural-Altaic, was widely accepted for some time, but largely abandoned early in the 20th century¹. The Altaic theory linking Tungusic, Mongolic, and Turkic is also rejected by most scholars¹. The combination of the Samoyedic and Finnic classes form the modern Uralic family, which is firmly established¹. Each of the five classes of his southern division are now considered to belong to separate language families, Tai–Kadai, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, and Dravidian respectively¹.
