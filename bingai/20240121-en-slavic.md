    Why does Bulgarian declension disappear?

The disappearance of declension in Bulgarian is a complex process influenced by several factors:

1. **Evolution from Old Church Slavonic**: Bulgarian evolved from Old Church Slavonic, which had an extensive system of declension with seven grammatical cases¹. Over time, Bulgarian has lost these noun cases but has developed a definite article, which is suffixed at the end of words¹.

2. **Vowel Merging**: One theory suggests that the merging of some vowels caused a lot of case endings to coincide, making them confusing and less meaningful². However, it's important to note that other Slavic languages also merged the same vowels but still have cases².

3. **Preference for Accusative Case**: Early Old Bulgarian texts show two ways of marking the different roles of words. One included the accusative case and the other a different case. Gradually, the accusative case became more widespread and preferred in usage until it eventually replaced all other cases apart from the vocative².

4. **Influence of the Balkan Sprachbund**: The Balkan Sprachbund is a region of language contact in the Balkans where areal features were exchanged between languages. Bulgarian and Macedonian are the languages most affected by this Sprachbund, which led to a loss or reduction of grammatical cases².

5. **Development of Articles**: The definite article developed from the demonstrative pronouns which were placed after the word and gradually merged with it. The indefinite article is still in the process of forming and it's as simple as placing "един/една/едно/едни" in front of the word².

It's important to note that language evolution is a complex process influenced by many factors, and the reasons listed above are theories based on linguistic research. The exact reasons may vary and overlap.

    Are there any declension left in old Bulgarian?

Yes, Old Bulgarian, which was the first literary period in the development of the language, had an extensive system of declension. It included seven grammatical cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, locative, instrumental, and vocative¹². 

However, over time, most of these cases disappeared. In the modern Bulgarian language, only the nominative and vocative cases are still in use¹. The numerical plural form, a vestige of the grammatical dual number which disappeared from the language in the Middle Ages, is also still used in the masculine whenever there is a precise amount of something¹.

    It seems that the disappearance of declension from English was largely due to the French influence of the Norman Conquest, but did a similar event occur in Bulgarian?

The disappearance of declension in Bulgarian is not directly attributed to a specific event or foreign influence like the Norman Conquest in English. However, the language has been influenced by various historical and cultural factors.

One significant influence on Bulgarian was the **Ottoman rule**, which lasted for more than five hundred years¹. Despite this, the majority of present-day Bulgarians tend to reject "non-Bulgarian" influences in their history and culture¹. This could have indirectly influenced the evolution of the Bulgarian language, including its grammatical structure.

Another important factor is the **Balkan Sprachbund**, a region of language contact in the Balkans where areal features were exchanged between languages². Bulgarian and Macedonian are the languages most affected by this Sprachbund, which led to a loss or reduction of grammatical cases².

However, it's important to note that language evolution is a complex process influenced by many factors, and the reasons listed above are theories based on linguistic research. The exact reasons may vary and overlap. The disappearance of declension in Bulgarian is likely the result of a combination of these influences over time.

    Which languages are influenced by Balkan Sprachbund?

The Balkan Sprachbund, also known as the Balkan language area, is an ensemble of areal features—similarities in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and phonology—among the languages of the Balkans¹. The languages most influenced by this phenomenon include:

- **Albanian**
- **Bulgarian**
- **Macedonian**
- **Romanian**
- **Greek** and **Serbian** (to a lesser extent)³
- **Aromanian** (a close relative of Daco-Romanian spoken mostly in Greece and Macedonia)
- **Daco-Romanian** (the language of Romania)
- **Romani** (the language of the Romani people)
- **Turkish**⁴

These languages share their similarities despite belonging to various separate language family branches. The Slavic, Hellenic, Romance, Albanian, and Indo-Aryan branches all belong to the large Indo-European family, and the Turkish language is non-Indo-European¹. The shared features confer the Balkan languages a special similarity¹.

    Did declensions of the languages disappear?

Yes, declensions have disappeared in many languages over time. This is often a result of language simplification and evolution. Here are some examples:

- **Albanian**: Albanian still retains declension of nouns and adjectives, and the conjugation of verbs¹³¹⁴.
- **Macedonian**: Macedonian exhibits a number of grammatical features that distinguish it from most other Slavic languages, such as the elimination of case declension⁴.
- **Romanian**: Romanian has reduced declensions to only three forms (nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and vocative) from the original six or seven¹³.
- **Greek**: Greek still retains declension in its grammar⁹.
- **Serbian**: Serbian retains declension in its grammar¹¹.
- **Aromanian**: Aromanian grammar has features that distinguish it from Romanian, an important one being the complete disappearance of verb infinitives²².
- **Daco-Romanian**: Daco-Romanian has reduced declensions to only three forms (nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and vocative) from the original six or seven²¹.
- **Romani**: Information about declension in Romani is not readily available.
- **Turkish**: Turkish is an agglutinative language and uses a different system, relying on suffixes added to nouns and verbs¹⁶.

Please note that this is a general overview and the specifics can vary based on different dialects and historical changes within each language. Also, the disappearance of declensions does not necessarily mean a language is less complex, as other grammatical features may evolve to express similar meanings.

    Is Macedonia. Almost same as Bulgarian.

Macedonian and Bulgarian are closely related South Slavic languages, and they share many similarities in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and phonology². However, there are also significant differences between the two:

1. **Dialectal Basis**: Modern Bulgarian is based on the eastern dialect, while modern Macedonian is based on the western dialect, spoken around the city of Debar³.

2. **Codification**: Modern Macedonian was codified right after WWII and includes some Serbian elements³.

3. **Mutual Intelligibility**: While there is some mutual comprehension between Macedonian and Bulgarian, Macedonian is often just as linguistically related to Serbian as it is Bulgarian⁴.

4. **Dialect Continuum**: All South Slavic languages, including Macedonian and Bulgarian, form what is called a dialect continuum⁴.

So, while Macedonian and Bulgarian have a high degree of mutual intelligibility, they are distinct languages with their own unique characteristics. It's important to respect these differences and the cultural and historical significance they hold for the people who speak these languages.

    Bulgarian and Serbian are quite different, aren't they?

Yes, Bulgarian and Serbian are indeed quite different, despite both being South Slavic languages². Here are some of the key differences:

1. **Grammar**: Bulgarian has lost the case declension system that is still present in Serbian¹². Bulgarian has a definite article which is suffixed to the end of words, while Serbian does not¹.

2. **Vocabulary**: While there is a degree of mutual intelligibility, there are many false friends - words that sound similar but have different meanings in the two languages¹.

3. **Pronunciation**: The stress patterns in Bulgarian and Serbian can be quite different, which can lead to differences in pronunciation¹.

4. **Script**: Serbian is written in both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, while Bulgarian is written only in Cyrillic⁴.

5. **Influences**: Serbian has had more influences from other Slavic languages like Russian, while Bulgarian has been influenced by non-Slavic languages due to its geographical location²⁴.

It's important to note that despite these differences, Bulgarian and Serbian share a common linguistic heritage and have many similarities as well. However, they are distinct languages each with their own unique characteristics and complexities.

    Which is easier, Bulgarian or Serbian?

The difficulty of learning a language can vary greatly depending on a person's native language, their language learning history, and the resources available for learning. However, some general observations can be made about Bulgarian and Serbian:

- **Bulgarian**: Bulgarian has lost the case declension system that is still present in many Slavic languages, which could potentially make it easier for speakers of languages without a case system¹. However, Bulgarian is considered one of the more difficult Slavic languages⁴. It falls within category III in terms of difficulty, meaning it's harder to learn than French, Spanish, and German but easier than Chinese or Japanese⁵.

- **Serbian**: Serbian retains the case declension system, which can be challenging for learners not familiar with such systems². Serbian is written in both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, which might be an advantage for learners already familiar with one of these scripts².

It's important to note that these are general observations and the actual difficulty can vary greatly depending on individual factors. It's recommended to try out both languages and see which one you feel more comfortable with. Happy learning! 😊

    Bulgarian orthography is similar to Russian, but Serbian Cyrillic orthography is not.

Yes, you're correct. While Bulgarian, Serbian, and Russian all use the Cyrillic script, there are differences in their orthographies:

- **Bulgarian and Russian**: Both languages use the Cyrillic script, and there are many similarities between the two. However, there are minor differences between the Bulgarian and Russian alphabets. The Bulgarian alphabet has 30 letters, while the Russian alphabet includes three additional letters ('ы', 'э', 'ё'), bringing its total to 33 letters¹.

- **Serbian and Russian**: The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet is distinct and does not correspond exactly to the Russian alphabet. It has several letters for sounds that do not exist in Russian, and lacks sounds for which Russian has distinct characters⁵. Additionally, Serbian italic and cursive forms of lowercase letters б, г, д, п, and т differ from those used in other Cyrillic alphabets⁴.

It's important to note that these are general observations and the actual orthographies can vary greatly depending on individual factors. Each language has its own unique characteristics and complexities..

    Pronouncially, does Bulgarian inherit the Old Church Slavic?

Yes, Bulgarian does inherit certain phonetic characteristics from Old Church Slavonic, which is also referred to as Old Bulgarian⁵. However, the phonology of Bulgarian has evolved over time and has been influenced by various factors¹.

The phonemic inventory of Contemporary Standard Bulgarian (CSB) has been a contested and controversial matter for decades, with two major currents, or schools of thought, forming at national and international level¹. The first one considers that there are only 28 phonemes in Contemporary Standard Bulgarian: 21 consonants, 1 semivowel and 6 vowels and that only one of them, the semivowel j, is palatal¹. This was the general consensus reached by all major Bulgarian linguists prior to the Soviet occupation of Bulgaria in 1944, and still continues to be the view held by multiple modern Bulgarian and probably a majority of Western phonologists¹.

The second school of thought is based on a sketch of Eastern Bulgarian consonantism made by Russian linguist Nikolai Trubetzkoy in his 1939 book Principles of Phonology, where he introduced palatalization as additional phonemic distinction in Bulgarian, much like in his native language, Russian¹. In Bulgaria, the concept was launched in the late 1940s by two younger linguists, Stoyko Stoykov and Lyubomir Andreychin, who proclaimed the existence of 17 new palatalized phonemes, rounding Standard Bulgarian's phonemic inventory to 45 phonemes, 18 of which are palatal¹.

According to their place of articulation, Bulgarian vowels can be grouped in three pairs— front vowels: е ( / ɛ /) and и ( / i / ); central vowels: а ( / a /) and ъ ( / ɤ / ); and back vowels: о ( / ɔ /) and у ( / u / ). Here / ɛ /, / a / and / ɔ / are "low", and / i /, / ɤ / and / u / are "high"¹.

It's important to note that language evolution is a complex process influenced by many factors, and the reasons listed above are theories based on linguistic research. The exact reasons may vary and overlap. The phonology of Bulgarian today is distinct and has its own unique characteristics.

    Bulgarian does not seem to have a strong palatalization of consonants as Russian.

Yes, you're correct. Bulgarian and Russian, while both Slavic languages, have different degrees of palatalization.

**Russian** has a strong degree of palatalization. It distinguishes hard consonants from soft consonants and from iotated consonants, making four sets in total: /C Cʲ Cj Cʲj/, although /Cj/ in native words appears only at morpheme boundaries¹. Russian also preserves palatalized consonants that are followed by another consonant more often than other Slavic languages do¹.

On the other hand, **Bulgarian** does not have a strong palatalization of consonants. The palatalization of the Proto-Slavic trilled /rj/ is affected to a different degree in almost all Slavic languages. In Bulgarian, it is partially lost².

It's important to note that these are general observations and the actual phonologies can vary greatly depending on individual factors. Each language has its own unique characteristics and complexities.

    Which is similar to. Proto Slavic in pronounce. Bulgarian or Russian?

Both Bulgarian and Russian have evolved from Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed ancestor of all Slavic languages¹. However, they have developed distinct phonetic characteristics over time².

**Bulgarian**: Bulgarian has lost the case declension system that is still present in many Slavic languages, which could potentially make it easier for speakers of languages without a case system¹. However, Bulgarian is considered one of the more difficult Slavic languages⁴. It falls within category III in terms of difficulty, meaning it's harder to learn than French, Spanish, and German but easier than Chinese or Japanese.

Russian also preserves palatalized consonants that are followed by another consonant more often than other Slavic languages do¹.

In terms of pronunciation, neither Bulgarian nor Russian is exactly like Proto-Slavic, as languages naturally evolve and change over time¹. However, both languages retain elements of Proto-Slavic, and studying either would provide insights into the phonetic characteristics of the ancestral language¹.

    Does this mean that the Bulgarian language has changed in a direction that weakens those distinctions?

Yes, that's correct. Over time, the Bulgarian language has evolved in a way that has reduced the distinction between hard and soft consonants, a feature that is more prominent in other Slavic languages like Russian¹.

The phonemic inventory of Contemporary Standard Bulgarian (CSB) has been a contested and controversial matter for decades, with two major currents, or schools of thought, forming at national and international level¹. The first one considers that there are only 28 phonemes in Contemporary Standard Bulgarian: 21 consonants, 1 semivowel and 6 vowels and that only one of them, the semivowel j, is palatal¹.

    In short, Bulgarians simplified in terms of declension and pathologization.

Yes, that's a good summary. Over time, Bulgarian has simplified its language structure in terms of declension and palatalization. The case declension system, which is present in many Slavic languages, has been lost in Bulgarian. Similarly, the distinction between hard and soft consonants, a feature more prominent in languages like Russian, has been reduced in Bulgarian. These changes are part of the natural evolution of languages, influenced by many factors including geography, history, and cultural interactions.

##

    Does the Old Church Slavic also have a strong distinction of palatalization?

Yes, Old Church Slavonic, also known as Old Bulgarian, did have a strong distinction of palatalization¹. This is evident in the Proto-Slavic sound change known as the Slavic first palatalization, which manifested as regressive palatalization of inherited Balto-Slavic velar consonants¹. 

This palatalization was an important tendency in Proto-Slavic and operated throughout the Common Slavic period (ca. 300–1000 CE)¹. Historically, speakers resolved the opposition between a velar consonant and a front (palatal) vowel by assimilating the place of articulation of the velar consonant to that of the front vowel, thereby palatalizing it¹. This phenomenon is very common in the phonetic history of languages¹.

However, it's important to note that language evolution is a complex process influenced by many factors, and the reasons listed above are theories based on linguistic research.

    Is the Old Church Slavonic almost same as the Common Slavic?

Old Church Slavonic, also known as Old Bulgarian, is very close to a vague "Common Slavic", but it is still later than Proto-Slavic³. It was the first Slavic literary language and was compiled from elements of various Slavic languages and dialects⁴. It began its history as a language that no one had ever spoken, an artificial or composed language⁴.

Old Church Slavonic played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions¹. Some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use this later Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day¹.

As the oldest attested Slavic language, Old Church Slavonic provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages¹. However, it's important to note that language evolution is a complex process influenced by many factors, and the reasons listed above are theories based on linguistic research. The exact reasons may vary and overlap. The phonology of Old Church Slavonic today is distinct and has its own unique characteristics..
