    I want to talk about constructed languages.

Constructed languages, often shortened to conlangs, are languages whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary are consciously devised for a specific purpose, rather than having developed naturally¹. They may be created for a work of fiction, for experimentation in fields like linguistics and cognitive science, for artistic creation, for fantasy role-playing games, and for language games¹.

Constructed languages can be categorized into several types, including auxiliary, ritual, engineered, and artistic (including fictional) languages². Some well-known constructed languages include Esperanto, which is the most popular auxiliary language ever invented, and Klingon, a language created for the Star Trek franchise⁴.

Would you like to know more about a specific constructed language or aspect of constructed languages? I'm here to help! 😊.

    Peano's Interlingua.

Peano's Interlingua, also known as **Latino sine flexione** (Latin without inflections) or **Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua** (IL de ApI), is an international auxiliary language¹. It was compiled by the **Academia pro Interlingua** under the chairmanship of the Italian mathematician **Giuseppe Peano** (1858–1932) from 1887 until 1914¹.

The language is a simplified version of Latin and retains its vocabulary¹. It was published in the journal **Revue de Mathématiques** in an article of 1903 entitled **De Latino Sine Flexione, Lingua Auxiliare Internationale** (meaning On Latin Without Inflection, International Auxiliary Language)¹. The article argued that other auxiliary languages were unnecessary, since Latin was already established as the world's international language¹.

Peano's Interlingua is based on the idea that there exists an international vocabulary in the languages of Europe which suffices for most communication, especially for scientific communication⁴. Peano's work on this language gained him a reputation among the auxiliary language movement¹. However, most mathematicians were put off by the artificial appearance of the language, and made no attempt to read it¹.

    A priori languages in 17th century England.

In the 17th century, the concept of **a priori languages** was explored by several individuals in England. These are languages that are designed from scratch, with their own unique phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, rather than being based on existing natural languages².

One notable figure in this field was **Francis Lodwick** (1619–1694), a merchant of Flemish origin who lived in London¹. He was a pioneer of a priori languages, which in the 17th century were referred to as 'philosophical languages'¹. Lodwick had been working on a universal alphabet for some time, and his work gained him a reputation among the auxiliary language movement¹. His alphabet consists of a system of representing consonants systematically; symbols indicating place of articulation (labial, dental, palatal, velar, sibilant) are modified by indication of the manner of articulation (voiced, voiceless, aspirated, nasal). Vowels are added as diacritics¹.

Lodwick's work was part of a broader trend in 17th-century England, where there was interest in creating a universal language to facilitate international communication and learning¹. This was a time of great linguistic diversity, with people in England speaking a variety of languages including English, Spanish, French, Dutch, and others³.

    Who are the successors?

The successors of Francis Lodwick in the field of constructed languages include several individuals who were part of a group that took up the task of constructing a philosophical language left unfinished by John Wilkins¹. This group included **Andrew Paschall** (c. 1630–c. 1696), **Thomas Pigott**, **Robert Hooke**, and **John Ray**, the latter being former members of Wilkin's original committee¹.

In addition, **L. L. Zamenhof**, the creator of **Esperanto**, the most widely used constructed international auxiliary language, chose Ludwik as his non-Jewish name in honor of Francis Lodwick¹.

It's also worth noting that Lodwick's approach to constructing a universal alphabet had parallels with the **tengwar alphabet**, developed by **J. R. R. Tolkien** in the 1930s¹.

    Did the men who have owner of Francis Lodwick?

Francis Lodwick was not owned by anyone. He was a merchant of Flemish origin who lived in London¹. His name appears in "A Collection of the Names of the Merchants living in and about the City of London (1677)", with the address "Fan-church street" (Fenchurch Street)¹. He did not have any higher education and was admitted as a Fellow to the Royal Society at the age of 60¹. 

John Aubrey (1626–1697) reported that there was a group of men taking up the task of constructing a philosophical language left unfinished by John Wilkins (d. 1672). This group included Lodwick, besides Andrew Paschall (c. 1630–c. 1696), Thomas Pigott, Robert Hooke and John Ray, the latter being former members of Wilkin's original committee¹. 

Lodwick had been working on a universal alphabet for some time, and Wilkins had borrowed some of Lodwick's papers for his 1668 Essay¹. Hooke notes in his diary for 12 November 1673 that Lodwick had lent him a revised version of his universal alphabet¹. For 10 July 1675, Hooke notes that Lodwick had discussed the universal character with him and on 28 that he (Hooke) himself had written in the character¹. The group maintained correspondence until at least 1682¹.

    Was Zamenhof in honor of Francis Lodwick?

Yes, **L. L. Zamenhof**, the creator of **Esperanto**, the most widely used constructed international auxiliary language, chose **Ludwik** as his non-Jewish name in honor of **Francis Lodwick**¹². Francis Lodwick was a pioneer of a priori languages, what in the seventeenth century was called a 'philosophical language'². Zamenhof admired Lodwick's work and honored him by adopting a variation of his name¹². If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    Was Zamenhof influenced by Francis Lodwick?

Yes, **L. L. Zamenhof**, the creator of **Esperanto**, was influenced by **Francis Lodwick**¹². While at university, Zamenhof began using the Russian name Lyudovik (also transcribed Ludovic or translated as Ludwig) in place of Lazar, possibly in honor of Francis Lodwick, who in 1652 had published an early conlang proposal¹. This shows that Zamenhof had knowledge of Lodwick's work and was influenced by it¹². If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    I want to know John Wilkins.

**John Wilkins** (14 February 1614 – 19 November 1672) was an Anglican clergyman, natural philosopher, and author¹. He was one of the founders of the **Royal Society**¹. He served as the **Bishop of Chester** from 1668 until his death¹. Wilkins is one of the few persons to have headed a college at both the **University of Oxford** and the **University of Cambridge**¹.

Wilkins was a polymath, although not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period¹. His personal qualities were brought out, and obvious to his contemporaries, in reducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford, in founding the Royal Society on non-partisan lines, and in efforts to reach out to Protestant Nonconformists¹. He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time¹.

He is particularly known for **An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668)** in which, amongst other things, he proposed a universal language and an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system¹.

Wilkins lived in a period of great political and religious controversy, yet managed to remain on working terms with men of all political stripes¹. He was key in setting the Church of England on the path toward comprehension for as many sects as possible, "and toleration for the rest"¹. Gilbert Burnet called him "the wisest clergyman I ever knew. He was a lover of mankind, and had a delight in doing good"¹.

    Please explain his philosophical language.

John Wilkins is best known for his work "An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language" (1668), in which he proposed a new universal language¹². This language was meant primarily to facilitate international communication among scholars, but was also envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants¹.

The language was designed to replace Latin as a completely unambiguous tongue with which scholars and philosophers could communicate³. The goal was to represent the entire knowledge of the universe³. Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an auxiliary to—not a replacement of—existing natural languages¹.

The work is in five parts, of which the fourth contains the discussion of the "real character" and "philosophical language". The third deals with "philosophical grammar" (universal grammar). The last part is the "alphabetical dictionary"¹.

The stimulus for Wilkins to write the Essay came from the Council of the Royal Society, in 1662. The work was delayed by the Great Fire of London of 1666, which destroyed some of it in draft¹. The book was written by Wilkins, assisted by John Ray, Francis Willughby, and others¹.

An influence was the Ars Signorum of George Dalgarno. Also influential, as Wilkins acknowledged, was The Ground-Work or Foundation Laid ... for the Framing of a New Perfect Language (1652) by Francis Lodwick¹.

##

    Please show examples in his language.

In John Wilkins's philosophical language, words were constructed to represent categories and subcategories of knowledge. Here are a few examples¹³:

- **de** means element
- **deb** represents the first of the elements, fire
- **deba** signifies a portion of the element of fire, a flame

The language was designed such that the structure of the word itself would provide information about its meaning¹. However, it's important to note that these examples are second-hand, as the original work is not widely available¹.

    Are there the similar languages?

Yes, there are several languages that have similarities to John Wilkins's philosophical language. These are often referred to as "philosophical" or "taxonomic" languages³. They are designed with the intention of classifying every concept, thing, and idea within the universe into categories². Here are a few examples:

- **George Dalgarno's Ars Signorum**: Dalgarno, a contemporary of Wilkins, also developed a philosophical language. His work, Ars Signorum, was an influence on Wilkins¹.

- **Francis Lodwick's Language Scheme**: Lodwick, another contemporary of Wilkins, proposed a language scheme that was acknowledged by Wilkins as an influence on his own work¹.

- **Oligosynthetic Languages**: These languages, like Wilkins's language, are made of compound words, which are coined from a small set of morphemes³.

- **Toki Pona**: This is a contemporary constructed language that, like Wilkins's language, uses a limited set of root words to produce phrases³.

It's important to note that while these languages share some similarities with Wilkins's philosophical language, each has its own unique features and structures¹²³. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    Ro seems to be the one of his succrssor. Is net.

**Ro** is indeed a constructed language that shares some similarities with John Wilkins's philosophical language. It was created by Reverend Edward Powell Foster in 1904¹. Like Wilkins's language, Ro is a taxonomic language, which means it classifies words based on categories of human knowledge¹. However, while there may be similarities, it's important to note that Ro is not a direct successor of Wilkins's language. Each of these languages has its own unique features and structures¹.

    Wilkins is influenced by Chinese characters, isn't it?

John Wilkins's work on his philosophical language, as detailed in "An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language", does not explicitly mention being influenced by Chinese characters¹. However, it's worth noting that his system of classification and representation of knowledge shares some conceptual similarities with the way Chinese characters represent ideas¹.

In fact, Jorge Luis Borges, in his essay "El idioma analítico de John Wilkins" (The Analytical Language of John Wilkins), compares Wilkins’ classification to the fictitious Chinese encyclopedia "Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge"³.

Moreover, there is a discussion on Reddit about Chinese characters appearing in an English book from 1668, which is John Wilkins' "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language"². This suggests that Wilkins might have had some exposure to Chinese characters, but it's unclear how much this influenced his work².

    Tangut script is one of the successors of Chinese characters, I think.

The **Tangut script** was a logographic writing system, used for writing the extinct Tangut language of the Western Xia dynasty¹. It was created by the high-ranking official **Yeli Renrong** in 1036¹. The Tangut characters are similar in appearance to Chinese characters, with the same type of strokes, but the methods of forming characters in the Tangut writing system are significantly different from those of forming Chinese characters¹.

While the Tangut script was inspired by Chinese characters, it's not accurate to say it's a successor of Chinese characters¹. The Tangut script was developed independently and has its own unique features and structures¹. It was used until the 16th century - the most recent known inscription in the Tangut script dates to 1502⁵.

    Is Tangut language similar to Tibetian?

The **Tangut language** is an extinct language in the Sino-Tibetan language family¹. It was one of the official languages of the Western Xia dynasty, founded by the Tangut people in northwestern China¹. 

While it belongs to the same language family as Tibetan, it is not a direct variant or derivative of Tibetan. In fact, Tangut is commonly classified as a Qiangic or Gyalrongic language¹. On the basis of both morphological and lexical evidence, some researchers classify Tangut as a West Gyalrongic language⁵.

So, while Tangut and Tibetan are part of the same broad language family (Sino-Tibetan), they are distinct languages with their own unique features and structures¹²³⁴⁵.

    Does anyone try to write Tibetan language in Tangut script?

There is no widely available evidence to suggest that the Tibetan language has been written in the Tangut script¹². The Tangut script was specifically developed for the Tangut language, an extinct member of the Qiangic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family¹²³. It was used primarily in the Western Xia dynasty, which was founded by the Tangut people in northwestern China¹²³. 

While the Tangut script shares some similarities with Chinese characters, the methods of forming characters in the Tangut writing system are significantly different from those of forming Chinese characters². The Tangut script was used until the 16th century, with the most recent known inscription in the Tangut script dating to 1502¹².

    Is Tangut language used now?

No, the Tangut language is not used today. It is an extinct language in the Sino-Tibetan language family¹. Tangut was one of the official languages of the Western Xia dynasty, founded by the Tangut people in northwestern China¹. The Western Xia was annihilated by the Mongol Empire in 1227¹. The latest known text written in the Tangut language, the Tangut dharani pillars, dates to 1502¹, suggesting that the language was still in use nearly three hundred years after the collapse of Western Xia¹. However, the Tangut language and its unique script are extinct today, and only fragments of Tangut literature remain².

    Does the word "extinct" means "perish"?

Yes, the words "extinct" and "perish" have similar meanings, but they are used in different contexts¹. 

- "Extinct", when used to describe a language or a species, means that it is no longer in existence or use²⁴. For example, when a language is described as extinct, it means that there are no longer any native or fluent speakers of that language². Similarly, when a species is described as extinct, it means that all members of that species have died and the species no longer exists⁴.

- "Perish", on the other hand, is a verb that means to die or cease to exist¹. It is often used to describe the process of dying or decaying¹.

So, while both words involve the concept of ceasing to exist, "extinct" is typically used in a more specific context to describe languages or species that are no longer in existence²⁴, while "perish" is a more general term that can be used to describe the process of dying or decaying¹. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    Please explain the etymology of extinct in Latin.

The word "extinct" comes from the Latin word "extinctus" or "exstinctus", which is the past participle of "extinguere" or "exstinguere"¹²³. The verb "extinguere" or "exstinguere" means "to put out, quench; go out, die out; kill, destroy"¹. This verb is formed from the prefix "ex-", meaning "out", and "stinguere", meaning "to quench"¹²³. So, in its original Latin form, "extinct" essentially means "quenched" or "put out"¹²³. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    In my opinion: Zamenhof was able to create a language that remains to this day as a result of giving up on the idea of creating something completely out of nothing. A philosophical language should eventually be constructed as well, but it is realistic to use Chinese characters and pictographs as an intermediate step.

That's an interesting perspective! L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, indeed built upon existing languages rather than creating something entirely new. This approach likely contributed to the success and longevity of Esperanto.

Your idea about using Chinese characters and pictographs as an intermediate step in constructing a philosophical language is intriguing. Chinese characters are logograms, which represent words or morphemes (the smallest meaningful units in a language), rather than sounds. This means they can potentially be understood across languages, provided the reader is familiar with the characters.

However, creating a new philosophical language is a complex task that involves many considerations, including ease of learning, cultural neutrality, and expressiveness. It would be a significant challenge to develop a language that can accurately and unambiguously represent all human knowledge, as John Wilkins attempted with his philosophical language.

Nonetheless, the exploration and creation of constructed languages can offer valuable insights into linguistics, cognition, and communication. If you have any other thoughts or questions on this topic, feel free to share! 😊.

    What are some other constructed languages besides Esperanto?

There are many constructed languages besides Esperanto. Here are a few examples¹:

- **Volapük**: Created by Johann Martin Schleyer in 1879–1880, it was the first constructed language to generate international interest¹.

- **Ido**: Developed in 1907 by a group of reformist Esperanto speakers, it is the most successful offspring of Esperanto¹.

- **Interlingue**: Also known as Occidental, it was developed in 1922 by Edgar de Wahl and is a sophisticated naturalistic international auxiliary language¹.

- **Novial**: Created in 1928 by Otto Jespersen, a famous Danish linguist, it is another sophisticated naturalistic international auxiliary language¹.

- **Sona**: Developed in 1935 by Kenneth Searight, it is an agglutinative language with a universal vocabulary. Its 360 radicals can be combined to form new words¹.

- **Klingon**: A constructed language spoken by the fictional Klingon species in the Star Trek franchise¹.

- **High Valyrian**: A constructed language used in the television series Game of Thrones¹.

Each of these languages has its own unique features and structures¹. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊..

    Please explain George Dalgarno’s Ars Signorum.

George Dalgarno's **Ars Signorum** (Art of Signs), published in 1661, was a significant work in the field of constructed languages¹³⁴⁵. Dalgarno was a Scottish intellectual and schoolteacher who was interested in linguistic problems¹.

In Ars Signorum, Dalgarno attempted to set out the philosophical basis of language as he perceived it, and sketched a constructed language that would ideally represent each idea by a word, and related ideas by related words³. This language, known as Lingua Philosophica (the philosophical language), was one of the earliest constructed languages³.

Dalgarno's work aimed to create a language that was sufficiently rational to train its learners' minds in philosophical rigor³. His work was part of a broader movement in the 17th century that sought to create 'philosophical languages' or 'universal languages'¹.

    Which proposal by Wiklins or Dalgano is rated as more complete?

Both George Dalgarno's **Ars Signorum** and John Wilkins's **Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language** are significant works in the field of constructed languages¹. They represent different, and in various respects, antagonistic approaches¹.

However, Wilkins's **Essay** is often considered more influential than Dalgarno’s **Ars Signorum**¹. It tends to eclipse Dalgarno's work in the secondary literature, even though considering them in parallel is instructive¹. 

That being said, it's important to note that the majority of artificial language schemes remained unfinished and/or unpublished¹. The creation of a complete and functional constructed language is a complex task that involves many considerations, including ease of learning, cultural neutrality, and expressiveness¹.

    Show the related pictographs.

Pictographs, also known as pictograms, are symbols that convey their meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object¹. They are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance¹. A pictograph is a pictorial representation of data that uses icons, images, or symbols related to the central topic². A key is often included in the chart to indicate what word or numerical data group each icon represents².

Here are some examples of how pictographs are used:

- **Traffic Signs**: The top traffic sign warns people of horses and riders¹.
- **Hazard Symbols**: Some pictograms, such as Hazards pictograms, are elements of formal languages¹.
- **Infographics**: Pictographs are commonly used in infographics to represent data visually².
- **Ancient Art**: Pictographs are also found in prehistoric art, where they mean art painted on rock surfaces¹.

Unfortunately, I can't display images directly in this chat, but you can find many examples of pictographs by searching for "pictographs" or "pictograms" on the web¹². If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊..

    Show the pictographs related in philosophical languages.

Pictographs, or pictograms, are symbols that convey their meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object¹. They are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance¹. A pictograph is a pictorial representation of data that uses icons, images, or symbols related to the central topic². A key is often included in the chart to indicate what word or numerical data group each icon represents².

In the context of philosophical languages, pictographs can be seen as a way to represent complex ideas or concepts visually¹. For example, in most philosophical languages, words are constructed from a limited set of morphemes that are treated as "elemental" or "fundamental"². These elemental morphemes can be represented as pictographs, allowing for a visual representation of the language's structure and semantics¹².

Unfortunately, I can't display images directly in this chat, but you can find many examples of pictographs by searching for "pictographs in philosophical languages" on the web¹². If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    I asked the question assuming something like LOCOS.

I see, you're referring to **LOCOS** (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon), a microfabrication process¹. However, LOCOS is not a language or a script, but a technique used in semiconductor device fabrication¹. It involves the local oxidation of silicon to define regions of a silicon wafer¹.

If you're interested in constructed languages or scripts that use a visual or symbolic representation similar to pictographs, there are indeed some that exist. For example, Blissymbols or Blissymbolics is a constructed symbolic language that was invented by Charles K. Bliss (1897–1985) and consists of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts¹².

However, it's important to note that creating a new philosophical language or script is a complex task that involves many considerations, including ease of learning, cultural neutrality, and expressiveness¹². If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    What I am talking about is LoCoS (short for Lovers Communication System) developed by Yukio Ota.

Ah, I see. **LoCoS** (short for Lovers Communication System) is a pictorial language developed by Yukio Ota of Japan in 1964¹. It was meant as communication for the deaf and mute as well as for the illiterate¹. It is a universal and simple language, and as Ota put it, "It should emphasize the importance of communication among all the people of all the countries of the world"¹.

There are 8 major symbols in LoCoS¹:
- The Sun or day, represented by a circle.
- Man, represented by a ring shape.
- A thing, represented by a square.
- Thought, represented by a triangle with a slightly cut off top.
- Feeling, represented by a heart.
- Land or place, represented by a low straight line.
- The question indicator, a question mark.
- A point or existence, represented by a single point.

Words are made by combining different symbols in different ways¹. For example, if you put a dot inside a circle it will represent today, or if you put a fish in a ring shape it will be a fisherman¹. There are around 80 words that are official according to Yukio Ota¹. Words can be created as long as they follow the basic word syntax¹.

Sentences are formed by a combination of certain words¹. There are three rows that you use when writing sentences¹. The middle row is used for the core words (nouns, verbs, and direct/indirect objects)¹. The top row is used to modify verbs with adverbs¹. The bottom row is used to modify nouns using adjectives¹.

If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask! 😊.

    Which proposal of Blissymbol or LoCoS is rated as more complete?

Both **Blissymbolics** and **LoCoS** (Lovers Communication System) are complete systems in their own right, each with its own unique features and purposes.

**Blissymbolics**, created by Charles K. Bliss, is a semantic graphical language that is currently used by individuals with speech and language disabilities. It is composed of more than 5,000 distinct "Bliss-words".

**LoCoS**, developed by Yukio Ota, is a pictorial language designed to be universally understood, transcending linguistic and cultural barriers. It uses a set of basic symbols which can be combined to convey more complex concepts.

In terms of completeness, both systems have been developed to a level where they can express a wide range of concepts. However, their effectiveness can vary depending on the context in which they are used. For example, Blissymbolics is often used in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems for individuals with speech and language disabilities, while LoCoS has been used in signage and other visual communication tools.

It's also worth noting that the "completeness" of a constructed language can be subjective and depends on what one considers a language to be "complete". Some might argue that a language is never truly complete, as languages naturally evolve and change over time.
