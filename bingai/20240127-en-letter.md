    When people from non-kanji countries look at kanji, do they all look the same?

Kanji, the logographic characters used in the Japanese writing system, can appear complex and similar to those unfamiliar with them. However, just like any other script, with learning and practice, one can start to distinguish between different kanji characters. 

Each kanji has its own unique structure and meaning. Some people might initially find them similar due to their intricate design, but they are indeed distinct. It's similar to how someone unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet might initially find 'b' and 'd' or 'm' and 'w' similar, but with exposure and practice, they become easily distinguishable. 

So, while kanji characters might initially seem similar to people from non-kanji countries, they will start to look different as one learns more about them. Learning kanji is a gradual process, and over time, the differences between the characters become more apparent. It's all about familiarity and practice. üòä.

    Any testimonials?

Yes, there are several testimonials and studies that discuss the perception of Kanji by people from non-Kanji countries. Here are a few:

1. A paper titled "Kanji Matters in a Multilingual Japan" discusses the inherent complexity of Kanji and how it can present difficulties for learners of Japanese as a Second Language (JSL). The paper considers the development, education, and complexity of Kanji and whether they are a potential barrier to a more inclusive society¬π.

2. Another study, "Tackling the Kanji hurdle: Investigation of Kanji learning in Non-Kanji background learners," analyzes the criteria for different orders of Kanji taught to Japanese students from non-Kanji backgrounds. The study finds that the order in which Kanji is taught is indeed a vital consideration in developing more efficient Kanji teaching and learning strategies for students from non-Kanji backgrounds¬≤.

3. A research paper on "Learning Japanese Kanji writing method by International JSL" discusses how learners from non-Kanji countries learn and practice the Kanji writing method¬≥.

These testimonials and studies suggest that while Kanji can be challenging for learners from non-Kanji countries, with the right strategies and methods, it is possible to overcome these challenges. It's also important to note that the perception of Kanji can vary greatly among individuals, depending on factors such as their language background, learning strategies, and personal experiences.

    To a stranger, is there much difference in the difficulty of learning hieroglyphics and learning Chinese characters?

Learning hieroglyphics and Chinese characters can indeed be challenging, especially for individuals who are more accustomed to alphabetic writing systems. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Nature of the Writing Systems**: Both Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters are among the earliest writing systems in the world. They are based not on letters, but on pictures drawn from various natural things¬π. However, hieroglyphic writing was never solely a system of picture writing¬≤.

2. **Structural Differences**: Chinese characters have a structure that includes shared components called bushou (radicals), which can help in understanding the characters¬π. On the other hand, Egyptian hieroglyphs do not have a similar structure, making them potentially more challenging to decipher¬π.

3. **Evolution of the Systems**: Over time, picture-based signs like Egyptian hieroglyphics have become more abstract, compact, and fewer in number‚Åµ. In contrast, Chinese writing has been getting increasingly complex‚Åµ.

4. **Learning Approach**: The means of deciphering characters in logographic systems like Chinese and hieroglyphics can echo map-reading skills‚Å¥, which might be a different approach compared to learning alphabetic systems.

In conclusion, the difficulty of learning these systems can vary greatly depending on the individual's previous language experience, learning style, and the resources available for learning. It's also important to note that while there are challenges, many people have successfully learned to read and write in these systems. So, with the right approach and dedication, it's certainly possible to learn both hieroglyphics and Chinese characters.

    Which is more difficult: Egyptian hieroglyphics or Sumerian cuneiform?

The difficulty of learning a writing system like Egyptian hieroglyphics or Sumerian cuneiform can vary greatly depending on the individual's background, learning style, and previous experience with similar systems. However, there are some key differences between the two that might impact the learning process:

1. **Nature of the Scripts**: Sumerian cuneiform is a syllabary, where each character stands for the sound of a complete syllable‚Å¥. On the other hand, Egyptian hieroglyphs represent consonants¬π. This means that in hieroglyphs, a single glyph could be used to write different syllables as long as they contain the same consonant¬π. In contrast, in cuneiform, a single glyph represents a specific syllable¬π.

2. **Number of Symbols**: Cuneiform has over 700 symbols, and their meaning can change depending on the context of how they were written¬≥. This could potentially make cuneiform more challenging to learn.

3. **Historical Development**: It's believed that cuneiform probably preceded Egyptian hieroglyphic writing‚Åµ. We know of early Mesopotamian experiments and 'dead-ends' as the established cuneiform script developed‚Åµ. In contrast, the hieroglyphic system seems to have been born more or less perfectly formed and ready to go‚Åµ.

4. **Availability of Learning Resources**: The modern study of cuneiform belongs to the field of Assyriology¬≤. An estimated half a million tablets are held in museums across the world, but comparatively few of these are published¬≤. This could potentially limit the availability of resources for learning cuneiform.

In conclusion, while both scripts present their own unique challenges, the context-dependent nature and large number of symbols in cuneiform could potentially make it more difficult to learn than Egyptian hieroglyphics. However, this can vary greatly depending on the individual learner. It's also worth noting that both scripts are complex and rich in history, offering fascinating insights into the civilizations that used them..

    The hieroglyphic tradition has been carried over to the Latin script, but has the cuneiform tradition been carried over in any way to the present day?

Yes, the cuneiform tradition has indeed influenced modern scripts. The Mesopotamian cuneiform writing system, which originated in Sumer (present-day Iraq) around 3200 BC, is considered the origin of our present-day alphabet¬≤. This system evolved into ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic text and was later adapted by the Phoenicians into letters, emerging as the first alphabet system¬≤.

Cuneiform writing was a powerful form of written communication in the ancient Middle East and served as the vital cornerstone upon which modern writing was developed¬π. It contributed to the development of many modern writing forms¬π. In fact, in second millennium Anatolia, the scribes of Hattusa used cuneiform to write Hittite, Luwian, and Palaic, Indo-European languages related to Greek, Latin, and the Germanic language family from which English is descended‚Å¥.

So, while cuneiform itself may not be in use today, its influence can be seen in the development and evolution of many modern scripts. It's a testament to the enduring impact of ancient civilizations on our world today..

    Aren't hieroglyphics and cuneiform independent, and didn't the cuneiform lineage disappear?

Yes, you're correct. Hieroglyphics and cuneiform are indeed independent systems of writing. They were both invented in the Near East, but they developed into very different writing systems‚Å∂. 

Cuneiform, which originated in Sumer (present-day Iraq) around 3200 BC, was used for over a period of 10,000 years‚Å¥. It evolved into ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic text and was later adapted by the Phoenicians into letters, emerging as the first alphabet system‚Å¥. However, the cuneiform script itself is not directly linked to any modern writing systems¬π.

Hieroglyphics were used primarily by the ancient Egyptians to write their sacred texts, while cuneiform was used more for administrative purposes such as record keeping‚Å∂. 

The last known cuneiform tablet dates to 75 AD¬π. After that, the use of cuneiform gradually disappeared. Despite its disappearance, cuneiform's historical significance as an international graphic medium of civilization is immense¬≤. Its rediscovery and decipherment in the 19th century opened up the rich history and literature of ancient Mesopotamia to the modern world¬≥. So, while the cuneiform lineage may have disappeared in a direct sense, its influence is still felt in our understanding of early human civilizations..

    Cuneiform script developed from pictorial writing, which is similar to hieroglyphics.

Yes, you're correct. Both cuneiform and hieroglyphics developed from pictorial writing systems.

**Cuneiform**, developed by the Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) around 3000 B.C.E., was written with a reed stylus, leaving wedge-shaped impressions on soft clay tablets¬π¬≤‚Å¥. It was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era¬π. Over its history, cuneiform was adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian, such as Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Hurrian, Luwian, and Urartian¬π.

On the other hand, **Egyptian hieroglyphics** developed at some point prior to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150 -2613 BCE)‚Å∏. Hieroglyphic symbols may represent the objects they depict but usually stand for particular sounds or groups of sounds‚Å∂. The system used about 900 distinct signs during the Middle Kingdom period‚Å∑. The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom and Late Period, and on into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods‚Å∑.

While both systems started as pictorial representations, they evolved over time to represent sounds and concepts, allowing for more complex communication. However, it's important to note that despite their similar origins, the two systems developed independently and are distinct from each other‚Å∂..

    Explain the evolution of Sumerian cuneiform.

Cuneiform is a logo-syllabic writing system that was used to write several languages of the Ancient Near East¬π. It was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) around 3500 BCE¬π¬≤. The earliest cuneiform tablets, known as proto-cuneiform, were pictorial, addressing more concrete and visible subjects¬≤.

The evolution of Sumerian cuneiform can be summarized as follows:
- **Around 3500 BCE**: Cuneiform script was first developed by the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia¬≤.
- **Around 3200 BCE**: The writing of cuneiform was further advanced in the city of Uruk, which allowed for the creation of literature¬≤.
- **Around 3000 BCE**: Cuneiform script was refined¬≥.
- **2900 BCE - 2334 BCE**: Cuneiform script developed fully during the Early Dynastic Period of Mesopotamia¬≥.

The pictographs evolved into symbols that stood for words and sounds‚Å¥. Scribes used sharpened reeds to scratch the symbols into wet clay, which dried to form tablets‚Å¥. The system of writing became known as cuneiform‚Å¥. Over the course of its history, cuneiform was adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian¬π. The latest known cuneiform tablet dates to 75 AD¬π. Cuneiform was rediscovered in modern times in the early 17th century¬π. The modern study of cuneiform belongs to the field of Assyriology¬π. An estimated half a million tablets are held in museums across the world¬π..

    How were Sumerian sound values restored?

The restoration of Sumerian sound values is a complex process that involves the study of ancient texts, comparative linguistics, and the decipherment of cuneiform script. 

The Sumerian language first appeared in archaeological records around 3100 B.C. and dominated Mesopotamia for the next thousand years¬≤. It was mostly replaced by Akkadian around 2000 B.C. but held on as a written language in cuneiform for another 2,000 years¬≤. 

The decipherment of cuneiform script, which began in the 19th century, was a crucial step in restoring Sumerian sound values. Scholars used bilingual texts, such as the Behistun Inscription, which was written in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian (a later form of Akkadian). These texts served as a "Rosetta Stone" for cuneiform, allowing scholars to match the symbols with known languages and gradually decode Sumerian.

Additionally, the study of related languages and the careful analysis of available texts contributed to our understanding of Sumerian phonology. However, it's important to note that our knowledge of Sumerian pronunciation is still incomplete and the subject of ongoing research. 

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex process that involves many different fields of study, including linguistics, archaeology, and history. For a more detailed understanding, I would recommend further study or consulting a specialist in Sumerian or ancient languages..

    What is the proto-cuneiform?

The proto-cuneiform script was a system of proto-writing that emerged in Mesopotamia, eventually developing into the early cuneiform script used in the region's Early Dynastic I period¬π. It arose from the token-based system that had already been in use across the region in preceding millennia¬π. 

The earliest characters of proto-cuneiform are impressions of clay token shapes: cones, spheres, tetrahedrons pushed into the soft clay¬≤. Scholars believe the impressions were meant to represent the same things as the clay tokens themselves: measures of grain, jars of oil, animal herds¬≤. 

Proto-cuneiform emerged in what is now labeled the Uruk IV period (c. 3300 BC), and its use through the later Uruk III period¬π. The script slowly evolved over time, with signs changing and merging¬π. It was used for the first time in Uruk, later spreading to additional sites such as Jemdet Nasr¬π.

With the advent of the Early Dynastic period c. 2900 BC, the standard cuneiform script used to write the Sumerian language emerged¬π. However, it's still uncertain what the underlying language of proto-cuneiform texts were¬π. It's often assumed to be Sumerian¬π..

    Is there a list of proto-cuneiforms and their sound values and meanings?

There isn't a comprehensive list of proto-cuneiforms with their sound values and meanings readily available online. However, there are resources that could be helpful:

1. The **Wikipedia page** titled "List of cuneiform signs" provides a list of cuneiform signs, but it doesn't specifically focus on proto-cuneiform¬π.
2. A document titled "The Phonetic Values of the Cuneiform Characters" by George Smith, available on the Internet Archive, discusses the phonetic values of cuneiform characters¬≤.
3. The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) has transliterated all known proto-Elamite texts using the sign list of P. Meriggi¬≥.

Please note that deciphering ancient scripts is a complex process and the understanding of these scripts can evolve over time as more discoveries are made and research is conducted. It's always a good idea to refer to the latest academic research or consult with an expert in the field for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
