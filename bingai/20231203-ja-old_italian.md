    What is the "sien" in "avanti che sien di l√† discese"?

The word "sien" in the phrase "avanti che sien di l√† discese" is a form of the Italian verb "essere" (to be) in the subjunctive mood.

    It seems to be an old word form, but to which word does it correspond today?

The old Italian word "sien" corresponds to the modern Italian word "siano", which is the third person plural form of the verb "essere" (to be) in the present subjunctive tense. The subjunctive mood is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. So, "sien" in old Italian is "siano" in modern Italian.
