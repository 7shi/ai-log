    For studying Indian languages. What language?

India is a linguistically diverse country with several languages spoken across its regions. Here are a few of the major languages:

1. **Hindi**: It's the most widely spoken language in India and the first language of more than 40% of the population.
2. **Bengali**: It's the second most spoken language in India, predominantly in the eastern states.
3. **Telugu**: It's widely spoken in the southern part of India, especially in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
4. **Marathi**: It's the official language of the state of Maharashtra, which includes Mumbai.
5. **Tamil**: It's one of the oldest languages in the world, spoken in the state of Tamil Nadu and also in Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Malaysia.
6. **Urdu**: It's one of the official languages of India and is similar to Hindi in spoken form.
7. **Gujarati**: It's the official language of the state of Gujarat.
8. **Kannada**: It's spoken in the state of Karnataka.
9. **Odia**: It's the official language of the state of Odisha.
10. **Malayalam**: It's spoken in the state of Kerala and the union territory of Lakshadweep.

Each of these languages has its own unique script and grammar. The choice of language to study would depend on your interest, the region of India you're interested in, or the community you wish to communicate with. If you could provide more details, I could give a more specific recommendation. 😊.

    Eventually I think that all of these languages should be studied. But I cannot study all of them simultaneously. In what order would it be linguistically efficient to learn them?

Learning multiple languages efficiently involves considering factors such as linguistic similarities, the resources available for learning, and your personal interests or needs. Here's a suggested order based on linguistic families and the number of speakers:

1. **Indo-Aryan Languages**: These languages have some commonalities in grammar and vocabulary. Starting with **Hindi** could be beneficial as it's the most spoken language in India and has abundant learning resources. After Hindi, you could proceed with **Bengali** and **Marathi**.

2. **Dravidian Languages**: These languages are predominantly spoken in South India and have distinct differences from Indo-Aryan languages. You could start with **Telugu** or **Tamil**, as they have a large number of speakers and learning resources. After that, you could learn **Kannada** and **Malayalam**.

3. **Other Languages**: Finally, you could learn **Urdu**, **Gujarati**, and **Odia**. Urdu is similar to Hindi in its spoken form but uses a different script. Gujarati and Odia are less widely spoken and might have fewer resources for learning, but they are important for specific regions.

Remember, this is just a suggestion. The order could change based on your personal interests, the regions you're interested in, or the communities you wish to communicate with. Happy learning! 😊

##

    Including Sanskrit and Pali.

Including **Sanskrit** and **Pali** in your language learning journey can be very enriching, especially if you're interested in ancient literature and Buddhist texts. Here's how you might incorporate them:

1. **Sanskrit**: It's the classical language of India and the liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It's also the root of many Indo-Aryan languages and has influenced several others. Learning Sanskrit after Hindi could be beneficial due to their similarities.

2. **Pali**: It's the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism and was used in the writing of the earliest Buddhist scriptures. Pali is not directly related to Sanskrit but has been heavily influenced by it. You might choose to learn Pali after Sanskrit.

Remember, the order of learning these languages can be adjusted based on your personal interests and goals. Happy learning! 😊

    Is Pali morphologically intermediate between Sanskrit and Hindi?

Pali is a Middle Indo-Aryan language and is considered to be closely related to Sanskrit, an Old Indo-Aryan language¹³. However, it's important to note that Pali is not considered a direct descendant of Sanskrit³⁴. 

Pali and Sanskrit share many common characteristics, and those familiar with both can easily recognize these similarities¹. However, Pali is not considered morphologically intermediate between Sanskrit and Hindi. While Hindi is a direct descendant of Sanskrit, Pali is considered a Prakrit language, a group of Middle Indo-Aryan languages⁴.

In terms of morphology, Pali has simpler grammatical structures compared to Sanskrit. For instance, Pali does not have the complex system of declensions found in Sanskrit¹. On the other hand, Hindi, while it has evolved significantly from Sanskrit, has retained some elements of Sanskrit's morphological complexity.

So, while Pali shares characteristics with both Sanskrit and Hindi, it's not accurate to describe it as morphologically intermediate between the two. Each of these languages has its own unique features and complexities. 😊

##

    Are there any other Prakrit that are eligible for the study?

Yes, there are several other Prakrit languages that are significant for study, particularly if you're interested in ancient Indian literature and linguistics¹². Here are a few:

1. **Shauraseni Prakrit**: This was the chief dramatic Prakrit, used in drama and other literary works⁴.
2. **Magadhi Prakrit**: This language was used in the eastern part of India and is associated with the rise of Buddhism⁴.
3. **Maharashtri Prakrit**: This was the most popular Prakrit for literature, and it evolved into Marathi⁴.
4. **Gandhari Prakrit**: This was used in the northwest part of the Indian subcontinent and has significant Buddhist literature⁵.

These Prakrit languages are closely related to Sanskrit and often studied alongside it⁵. They offer valuable insights into the linguistic and cultural history of the Indian subcontinent. 😊.

    Which Prakrit is closely related to Hindi?

**Shauraseni Prakrit** is said to be the one most closely related to Classical Sanskrit and its descendants include the languages of the Hindi Belt, the Central Zone of modern Indo-Aryan or Hindi languages². It was the chief language used in drama in medieval northern India². So, if you're looking for a Prakrit language that's closely related to Hindi, Shauraseni Prakrit would be a good choice. 😊

##

    Is Shauraseni similar to Pali?

Shauraseni Prakrit and Pali are both Middle Indo-Aryan languages, but they have distinct characteristics and are used in different contexts¹².

**Shauraseni Prakrit** was the chief language used in drama in medieval northern India¹. It is said to be closely related to Classical Sanskrit and its descendants include the languages of the Hindi Belt¹.

On the other hand, **Pali** is associated with the Buddhist scriptures and is not considered a direct descendant of Sanskrit². It's also not directly related to Shauraseni Prakrit³.

So, while both languages share the common characteristic of being Middle Indo-Aryan languages, they have different origins and uses, and are not considered to be very similar to each other¹²³. 😊

##

    Which Prakrit is morphologically similar to Pali?

**Ardhamagadhi Prakrit** is often considered morphologically similar to Pali¹. Both languages are Middle Indo-Aryan languages and share many common characteristics¹. Ardhamagadhi Prakrit differs from later Magadhi Prakrit in similar ways to Pali, and was often believed to be connected with Pali on the basis of the belief that Pali recorded the speech of the Buddha in an early Magadhi dialect¹. However, it's important to note that each Prakrit language has its own unique features and complexities¹². 😊.

    Are the words inherited from Sanskrit in Hindi, except for borrowing, quite deformed?

The words in Hindi that are inherited from Sanskrit have indeed undergone changes over time, but the term "deformed" might not be the most accurate description. Languages naturally evolve, and changes in pronunciation, spelling, and usage are a part of this process¹².

In the case of Hindi, which is an Indo-Aryan language, many words have roots in Sanskrit. Over centuries, these words have transformed as they've been passed down through generations. This transformation can be due to a variety of factors, including shifts in pronunciation, regional influences, and the simplification of word forms for everyday use¹².

For example, the Sanskrit word 'Sarpa' has become 'Saanp' in Hindi (meaning snake), and 'Manas' has become 'Mann' (meaning mind). These changes are not so much deformations as they are natural linguistic evolutions¹.

It's also important to note that modern Hindi continues to borrow words from Sanskrit, especially in the domains of literature, science, and philosophy. These borrowed words are often used in their original form without significant changes¹.

So, while the words in Hindi that are inherited from Sanskrit have changed over time, these changes are a natural part of the language's evolution¹². 😊.

##

    Is the situation same in Bengali or Marathi?

Yes, the situation is similar in both Bengali and Marathi. These languages, like Hindi, have evolved from Sanskrit and have undergone changes over time due to natural linguistic evolution⁶¹.

In **Bengali**, many words have roots in Sanskrit and have transformed as they've been passed down through generations⁶. For instance, the Sanskrit word 'Vriksha' (meaning tree) has become 'Briksho' in Bengali⁶.

Similarly, in **Marathi**, many words are derived from or have roots in Sanskrit. These words have also transformed over time. For example, the Sanskrit word 'Nayaka' (meaning leader) has become 'Nayak' in Marathi¹.

So, while the words in Bengali and Marathi that are inherited from Sanskrit have changed over time, these changes are a natural part of the language's evolution⁶¹. 😊.

    Does Tamil have many loan words from Sanskrit?

Yes, the Tamil language has absorbed many loanwords from Sanskrit, predominantly from Prakrit, Pali, and Sanskrit, ever since the early 1st millennium CE¹. Many of these loans are obscured by adaptations to Tamil phonology¹. There are many words that are cognates in Sanskrit and Tamil, in both tatsama (words borrowed as is) and tadbhava (words borrowed with phonetic modifications) forms¹.

However, it's important to note that there has been a conscious effort to return to the purity of Old Tamil by expunging borrowed words from Sanskrit, Hindi, English, and other languages³. For instance, when television broadcasting came to South India, Tamil had to find a Tamil word, and resorted to a loan translation tolaikaaTci (tolai means `distant' and kaaTci means `show') in lieu of using the English word or the All-India Sanskritic durdarsan, which is itself a loan translation from `tele-vision'³.

So, while Tamil does have many loan words from Sanskrit, there has also been a significant effort to maintain the language's originality¹³. 😊

    Tamil seems to be difficult because of the many liquid consonants.

Yes, Tamil does have a rich set of phonemes, including multiple liquid consonants, which can make it challenging for learners, especially those not familiar with Dravidian languages. 

In Tamil, there are five liquid consonants: 'ல்' (l), 'ள்' (ḷ), 'ழ்' (ḻ), 'ர்' (r), and 'ற்' (ṟ). Each of these has a distinct pronunciation, and using them correctly is crucial for accurate Tamil pronunciation.

However, don't let this discourage you. With practice and exposure, it's possible to master these sounds. Remember, every language has its own unique features and complexities, and overcoming these challenges can be a rewarding part of the language learning process. 😊

##

    How were these liquid consonants formed and fixed historically?

The formation and fixation of liquid consonants in Tamil, like in many languages, is a complex process that involves historical, phonetic, and linguistic factors¹².

Tamil, a Dravidian language of Southern India, is unusual among the world's languages in that some of its dialects have five contrasting liquid consonants¹². The characterization of these sounds involves articulatory geometry and kinematics, as well as their articulatory-acoustic relations¹².

The formation of these liquid consonants has been studied using multiple techniques such as static palatography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetometry (EMMA) for investigating both static and dynamic articulatory characteristics¹².

Historically, the liquids of Tamil have exhibited dialectal merger and neutralization phenomena¹². The articulatory data justify the postulation of a class of rhotics and a class of laterals in Tamil, but do not provide evidence in favor of a larger class of liquids¹².

It's important to note that the formation and fixation of these liquid consonants are influenced by a variety of factors, including the phonetic environment, morphological structure, and sociolinguistic factors¹².

However, the exact historical processes that led to the formation and fixation of these liquid consonants in Tamil are complex and are a topic of ongoing research in the field of linguistics¹². 😊

##

    Do the other Dravidian languages have many liquid consonants like Tamil?

Yes, other Dravidian languages also have multiple liquid consonants, similar to Tamil¹². However, the exact number and nature of these consonants can vary from language to language¹².

For instance, **Telugu**, another major Dravidian language, has a set of liquid consonants¹². **Kannada**, yet another Dravidian language, also has multiple liquid consonants⁵.

It's important to note that while these languages share the feature of having multiple liquid consonants, the specific phonetic and phonological characteristics of these consonants can differ significantly between languages¹².

So, while other Dravidian languages do have multiple liquid consonants like Tamil, the specifics can vary based on the language¹². 😊.

Yes, you're correct. The words 'నమస్కారం' (Namaskāraṁ) and 'ధన్యవాదాలు' (Dhanyavādālu) in Telugu are indeed borrowed from Sanskrit¹². They are similar to their counterparts in Hindi, which also has a significant number of words borrowed from Sanskrit. This is a common phenomenon in many Indian languages due to the historical and cultural influence of Sanskrit¹². 😊

    Is Telugu not as eager to paraphrase loan words as Tamil?

While both Telugu and Tamil have borrowed words from Sanskrit and other languages, the approach to these borrowed words can vary¹².

In Tamil, there has been a conscious effort to maintain the language's originality by paraphrasing or replacing borrowed words with native Tamil words¹. This is part of a broader language purification movement that seeks to limit the influence of other languages on Tamil¹.

On the other hand, Telugu has also borrowed many words from Sanskrit and other languages, but there hasn't been the same level of concerted effort to paraphrase or replace these borrowed words². Instead, borrowed words in Telugu are often used as they are, although they may undergo changes to fit Telugu's phonetic and grammatical structure².

So, while both languages have borrowed words, Tamil has been more proactive in paraphrasing or replacing these words compared to Telugu¹². 😊

    For those who know Hindi, does Telugu seem to have more loan words?

Yes, for those who know Hindi, Telugu might seem to have more loan words. This is because Telugu has been heavily influenced by Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language that belongs to the same Indo-Aryan language family as Hindi¹. An estimated 80% of Telugu vocabulary words come from Sanskrit¹. 

On the other hand, Hindi also has a significant number of words borrowed from Sanskrit². However, the degree of borrowing and the nature of the borrowed words can vary between the two languages¹².

So, while both Telugu and Hindi have many loan words, the specifics can vary based on the language¹². 😊
