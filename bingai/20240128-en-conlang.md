    Explain the philosophical language in the 16th century England, especially Wilkins'.

In the 16th century, philosophy in England was a unique synthesis of several philosophical frameworks, including Scholasticism, Humanism, Neo-Thomism, Aristotelianism, and Stoicism¬≥. However, John Wilkins, a prominent figure in the 17th century, is particularly known for his work "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language" (1668)‚Å∂.

Wilkins' work was an attempt to create a universal language to replace Latin, which had been the international language of scholars in Western Europe for about 1000 years‚Å∂. He believed that the inaccuracy of natural language impedes scientific progress‚Å∏. His universal language was envisioned not only for use by scholars and philosophers but also by diplomats, travelers, and merchants‚Å∂. Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an auxiliary to‚Äînot a replacement of‚Äîexisting natural languages‚Å∂.

The language was based on a taxonomic system of knowledge, where each phonetic and graphemic symbol represented a specific component of the knowledge included in the classification¬≤. For example, the written or spoken symbol for 'tree' would indicate the semantic components of a tree such as leaf-bearing, vegetation, soil-rooted, etc¬≤.

Wilkins' philosophical language was a significant development in the history of philosophical languages, aiming to represent the entire knowledge of the universe‚Å∏. However, enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined over time‚Å∂.

    Did anyone use Wilkins language in practice?

John Wilkins' universal language, as proposed in his work "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language" (1668), was primarily intended to facilitate international communication among scholars. It was also envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants¬≤. However, it appears that enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined over time¬≤. While there was immediate interest in the Essay, Wilkins is said to have regarded his work only in terms of a proof of concept¬≤. Therefore, it seems that the language was not widely adopted or used in practice.

    Has anyone implemented it on the computer?

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any specific information about an implementation of Wilkins' philosophical language on a computer. It's a complex and comprehensive system that was designed in the 17th century, long before the advent of modern computing. While it's theoretically possible to implement such a system on a computer, it would likely be a significant undertaking due to the language's complexity and the need to accurately represent its many nuances. If you're interested in this topic, you might want to look into the field of computational linguistics, which involves using computers to process and analyze human languages.

    Can you tell me more about Wilkins Philosophical Language?

John Wilkins, an Anglican clergyman, natural philosopher, and author, is best known for his work "An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language" (1668)¬π¬≤. In this work, he proposed a new universal language, primarily intended to facilitate international communication among scholars, but also envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants¬π.

The language was not meant to replace existing natural languages, but to serve as an auxiliary¬π. One of the aims of the Essay was to provide a replacement for Latin, which had been the international language of scholars in Western Europe for about 1000 years¬π. Wilkins and others criticized the arbitrary features of Latin that made it harder to learn¬π.

The work is structured into five parts, with the fourth part discussing the "real character" and "philosophical language". The third part deals with "philosophical grammar" (universal grammar), and the last part is the "alphabetical dictionary"¬π.

Wilkins' language was based on a classification of knowledge and was designed to be completely unambiguous, with the goal of representing the entire knowledge of the universe¬≥. Despite the immediate interest in the Essay, enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined over time¬π.

It's important to note that while Wilkins' language was innovative and influential, it was not widely adopted in practice. As for its implementation on a computer, there's no widely recognized or notable instance of such an endeavor. However, the principles behind it, such as the desire for a precise and unambiguous language, have influenced the development of programming languages and formal languages in computer science..

    It would be interesting to combine our universal language of the type considered by Wilkins with ideographs of a Chinese character like structure.

That's an intriguing idea! John Wilkins' Philosophical Language and Chinese characters each have unique features that could complement each other.

Wilkins' Philosophical Language, as detailed in his work "An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language" (1668), was a universal language meant to facilitate international communication among scholars, diplomats, travelers, and merchants¬π. It was not intended to replace existing languages, but to serve as an auxiliary tool¬π. The language assigns phonetic values to the Real Characters, allowing text to be read aloud without using any of the existing national languages‚Åµ.

On the other hand, Chinese characters are ideographs that express things or notions¬≥. They are accepted more generally than the languages do extend, allowing countries and provinces that don't understand each other's language to read each other's writings‚Å¥.

Combining these two systems could potentially create a language that is both phonetically expressive (like Wilkins' language) and ideographically rich (like Chinese characters). This could facilitate a deeper level of international communication and understanding. However, it would also be a complex task requiring careful consideration of linguistic, cultural, and practical factors. It's a fascinating concept to explore! üòä.

    I would also like to refer to the Tangut script, which was designed with reference to Chinese characters.

The **Tangut script** was indeed a logographic writing system, used for writing the extinct Tangut language of the Western Xia dynasty¬π. It was created by a high-ranking official named **Yeli Renrong** in 1036¬π. The script was inspired by Chinese characters and was used for translating Buddhist texts from Sanskrit and other languages‚Å¥. 

The Tangut script is similar in appearance to Chinese characters, with the same type of strokes, but the methods of forming characters in the Tangut writing system are significantly different from those of forming Chinese characters¬π. As in Chinese calligraphy, regular, running, cursive, and seal scripts were used in Tangut writing¬π. 

According to the latest count, 5863 Tangut characters are known, excluding variants¬π. The script continued to be used for a few centuries even after the collapse of the dynasty in 1227¬π. The most recent known inscription in the Tangut script dates to 1502‚Å¥.

As for combining a universal language like Wilkins' with ideographs of a Chinese character-like structure, it's an interesting concept. Wilkins' Philosophical Language was designed to facilitate international communication among scholars, diplomats, travelers, and merchants‚Å∂. Combining this with a logographic system like the Tangut script could potentially create a rich, visually expressive language. However, it would also be a complex task given the intricate nature of both systems. It's a fascinating idea to explore!.

    I would also like to refer to Ro language, which was designed with reference to Wilkins philosophical language.

The Ro language is an a priori constructed language created by Rev. Edward Powell Foster beginning in 1904¬≤. In Ro, words are constructed using a category system. For example, all words starting with "bofo-" signify colors; the word for red is "bofoc", and yellow is "bofof"¬≤‚Åµ. Foster did not simply try to design a better language in general, but to optimize his language for one design criterion: recognizability of unknown words¬≤.

As for the connection between Ro and Wilkins' philosophical language, it's important to note that both languages share a similar goal of creating a universal language based on the categorization of ideas‚Å∏. However, there isn't a direct reference indicating that Ro was designed with Wilkins' philosophical language in mind¬≤.

Combining a universal language like Wilkins' or Ro with ideographs of a Chinese character-like structure could indeed be an interesting concept. It would combine the categorization and universality of these philosophical languages with the visual representation of ideographs. However, creating such a language would be a complex task, requiring careful consideration of linguistic, cultural, and practical factors.

As for the Tangut script, it was indeed designed with reference to Chinese characters. However, it's important to note that while Chinese characters and the Tangut script are both logographic systems (where each symbol represents a word or a morpheme), their structures and principles of formation are quite different. The same caution would apply when considering the combination of these scripts with a philosophical language like Wilkins' or Ro. It's a fascinating idea, but implementing it would be a significant linguistic challenge. 

I hope this information helps! If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. üòä

    Blissymbols are more modern than the Chinese and Tangut scripts.

Yes, you're correct. **Blissymbols** is a modern constructed language conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography‚Åµ. It was created by Charles K. Bliss in 1949 and consists of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept‚Åµ. These symbols can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts‚Åµ. Blissymbols are used globally, especially for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments‚Å∂.

On the other hand, **Chinese scripts** have over three thousand years of recorded history¬π¬≥. They include logosyllabic systems such as the Chinese script itself, and adaptations to other languages¬π¬π. The Chinese scripts are written in various calligraphic hands, principally seal script, clerical script, regular script, semi-cursive script, and cursive script[^10^]¬π¬≤.

The **Tangut script** was a logographic writing system used for writing the extinct Tangut language of the Western Xia dynasty¬π. It was designed by the high-ranking official Yeli Renrong in 1036¬π. Although the dynasty collapsed in 1227, the script continued to be used for another few centuries¬π.

So, in terms of chronology, Blissymbols is indeed more modern than the Chinese and Tangut scripts. Combining elements from these diverse scripts could potentially result in a unique and comprehensive system of communication. However, the practicality and usability of such a system would need to be carefully considered and tested. It's an interesting idea! üòä

    Please introduce any other a priori languages or characters.

Sure, here are some examples of a priori languages:

1. **Ro**: Ro is an a priori constructed language created by Rev. Edward Powell Foster in 1904. It is organized by categories of knowledge and their relationships¬π.

2. **Solresol**: Solresol is a language by Fran√ßois Sudre, based on the solf√®ge musical scale. Words are formed from combinations of seven syllables associated with the musical notes¬π.

3. **Mirad**: Mirad, meaning 'world language', is an a priori constructed language, created by Paris-based author Paul Janssen¬π.

4. **Klingon**: Klingon is a constructed language spoken by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe¬π.

5. **Na'vi**: Na'vi is the constructed language of the Na'vi, the sentient humanoid alien inhabitants of the fictional world Pandora in the film Avatar¬π.

These languages are all a priori, meaning their vocabulary is not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated¬π. They each have unique characteristics and structures, reflecting the creativity and purpose behind their creation. Please note that while these languages are fascinating from a linguistic and cultural perspective, they are not widely spoken or used in everyday communication¬π.

    Any ideographic letters?

Yes, there are several ideographic scripts and symbols that represent ideas or concepts rather than specific words in a language. Here are a few examples:

1. **Dongba symbols**: Used by the Naxi people as a mnemonic in reciting oral literature¬π.
2. **Emoji**: Used in electronic messages and web pages¬≤.
3. **Adinkra**: A system of symbols used in West Africa¬≤.
4. **Nsibidi**: An ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to the Ejagham peoples of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon¬≤.
5. **Testerian**: A pictographic writing system that was used for missionary work in Mexico¬≤.
6. **Blissymbols**: A constructed ideographic script used primarily in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)¬≤.

These ideographic scripts and symbols can be read in many different languages and there is not always only a single way to read them¬π. They are often used as mnemonic aids for oral texts or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech¬≤..

    Toki Pona has Sitelen Sitelen.

Yes, you're correct! **Toki Pona**, a language invented by Sonja Lang, has a hieroglyphic script known as **Sitelen Sitelen**‚Å¥. This script was devised by Jonathan Gabel and is an alternative way to write Toki Pona‚Å¥. 

Sitelen Sitelen is based on various sources including the Toki Pona hieroglyphs script (Sitelen Pona), symbols found in graffiti and comics, early pagan and Christian signs and symbols, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, the Chinese script, the Mayan script, Mi'kmaq symbols, and the Naxi Dongba script‚Å¥.

In Toki Pona, "sitelen" can mean both drawing and writing, and John Clifford (jan Kipo) proposed "sitelen sitelen" as the way to say hieroglyphic using Toki Pona, literally ‚Äòdrawing writing‚Äô¬≥‚Åµ. This system of non-linear writing can be used to free your mind or break from regular thought¬π.

There's even a **Sitelen Sitelen renderer** by Olaf Janssen that can translate text into the glyph blocks¬≤¬π. However, Gabel advocates for learning to draw Sitelen Sitelen with your hands¬≤.

It's fascinating how languages like Toki Pona and scripts like Sitelen Sitelen can offer unique perspectives on communication and thought! üòä

    What is the history of Blissymbols?

Blissymbols, also known as Blissymbolics, is a constructed language conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography¬π. It was created by Charles K. Bliss (1897‚Äì1985), who was born Karl Kasiel Blitz to a Jewish family in Chernivtsi (then Czernowitz, Austria-Hungary)¬≤.

Bliss graduated as a chemical engineer at the Vienna University of Technology and joined an electronics company¬π. After the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, Bliss was sent to concentration camps but his German wife Claire managed to get him released¬≤. Bliss devised the symbols while a refugee at the Shanghai Ghetto and Sydney, from 1942 to 1949¬π. He wanted to create an easy-to-learn international auxiliary language to allow communication between different linguistic communities¬π. He was inspired by Chinese characters, with which he became familiar at Shanghai¬π.

Bliss published his system in Semantography in 1949¬π. Since the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate¬π. In 1971, Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with cerebral palsy, from the approach of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)¬π¬≥..

    What is the difference Blissymbols and Sitelen Sitelen?

Blissymbols and Sitelen Sitelen are both unique systems of writing, but they have some key differences:

- **Blissymbols**: This is a constructed language conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography. It consists of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept. These symbols can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts¬≤. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language¬≤.

- **Sitelen Sitelen**: This is a hieroglyphic script devised by Jonathan Gabel as an alternative way to write Toki Pona, a Pidgin-like language invented by Sonja Lang¬≥. Sitelen Sitelen is based on the toki pona hieroglyphs script (sitelen pona), symbols found in graffiti and comics, early pagan and Christian signs and symbols, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, the Chinese script, the Mayan script, Mi'kmaq symbols and the Naxi Dongba script¬≥.

The main difference between the two is that Sitelen Sitelen represents a spoken language (Toki Pona), while Blissymbols does not correspond to the sounds of any spoken language¬π¬≤. They are somewhat similar in that they're pictographic in inspiration¬π..

    Sitelen Pone (not Sitelen Sitelen) is similar in form to Blissymbols.

Sitelen Pone and Blissymbols are indeed similar in some ways, but they also have key differences. 

**Sitelen Pone** is a logographic writing system used to write Toki Pona, a constructed language created by Sonja Lang¬π. Each word in the language has a separate symbol, and it's used in various places such as memes and comics by the online Toki Pona community¬π.

On the other hand, **Blissymbols** is an ideographic writing system called Semantography, consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept‚Å∂. These symbols can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts‚Å∂. Blissymbols was created by Charles K. Bliss in 1949 and found use in the education of people with communication difficulties‚Å∂.

The main difference between the two is that Sitelen Pone represents a spoken language (Toki Pona), while Blissymbols does not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language‚Åµ‚Å∂. They are both pictographic in inspiration, but their usage and the languages they represent are quite different‚Åµ. 

It's fascinating to see how different systems of communication can have similarities and yet serve very different purposes! üòä

    I made a mistake; Sitelen Pona is correct.

No problem at all! **Sitelen Pona** is indeed a fascinating script. It's a way to write **Toki Pona**, a language created by **Sonja Lang**¬π. The script has separate symbols for each word in the language and is used in memes, comics, and a variety of other places by the online Toki Pona community¬π.

There's also a version called **Sitelen Pona Pona**, which was created with the aim to make Sitelen Pona suitable for typing and for inclusion in Unicode¬≤. It removes redundant information from the Sitelen Pona glyphs and gives them a consistent shape¬≤.

It's interesting to see how these scripts and languages evolve and influence each other. If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask! üòä
